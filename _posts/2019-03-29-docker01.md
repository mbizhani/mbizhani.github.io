## Introduction

Every process on your OS is executed from an application code and each process can interfere in other process's resources. 
The OS or the VM (if there is any) can provide some security and isolation mechanisms, 
however it can be different for each OS type and impose difficult configuration. 

_Docker_ provides a layered architecture for contents of the application(s), called an _Image_, 
and a _virtual environment_, called a _Container_, for running process(s) of the application(s). This _virtual environment_ is isolated by
- memory
- **storage** (similar to a _hypervisor_)
- **network** (similar to a _hypervisor_)

The image has a layered architecture, each layer contains the differences between the preceding layer and the current layer, and
on top of the layers, there is a writable layer (the current one) which is called the _container layer_[^docker_layer].

As mentioned above, there are some similarities between **Docker and a hypervisor** in providing isolated resources. 
The most important difference is their focus and application. If you want a **full-fledged OS**, the hypervisor
is the solution, and if you want a **light-weight isolated virtual environment for your process(s)**, Docker is the answer. 
For example, if you want to run a [MySQL](#mysql) server, Docker is the best choice, and if you want to execute a simulation app with
GUI, virtualization is the only choice. 

The following class diagram illustrates the overall parts involved in Docker installed on your box.
The associations show the relations between these parts and multiplicity of each association end highlights the detail of that end in the relation. 

![DockerClassDiagram](/assets/images/docker/DockerCD.png)

In a simple story, a container is started by the `docker daemon`, initiated by the `docker` client (command):
- At first, the image is downloaded from the registry if not already downloaded
- Docker can create one or another independent container from one image
- During container startup, Docker executes the command(s) provided in the image or passed as input parameters
- Docker initializes the container's network interface and attaches it to one of its virtual networks due to startup parameters ([example](#nginx--jenkins--nexus)), 
and even open a port on the host binding it to one of container's internal process
- Docker may mount a file/directory to its internal file/directory due to startup parameters

Container(s) can be created and started via one of following ways

App | Host/Node | Container
----|-----------|----------
`docker` | single | various unrelated containers
`docker-compose` | single | using single config file for multiple related containers or same-image containers for load balancing
Docker Swarm or Kubernetes | multiple | large deployment and centralized management for lots of containers

This post only uses `docker`.

## Installation
Docker is presented in two editions: **CE** (community edition) and **EE** (enterprise edition). Most of the time, people use its CE and also in the case of this tutorial.

The installation is different due to your OS. So the best reference is the Docker site.
- [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- **Note**: There is a general installation script for Linux distributions - `sudo curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh`

After installation
- In Linux, by default only `root` user can execute `docker` command. Adding group `docker` to a user's groups, the user has access to Docker.
So execute `usermod -a -G docker USER`.
- Executing `ifconfig` in your Linux box, `docker0` must be in the list of network interfaces.

## Docker CLI
After installing Docker, the `docker` command must be in your path and can be executed from your OS CLI app.

Following table shows some common usages of `docker` command.

Command | Description
--------|------------
`docker version` | Show version information of installed Docker client and server
`docker image ls` | List of image(s) on your host
`docker image inspect IMAGE` | Display detailed information on the image
`docker image pull IMAGE` | Download the image from a registry
`docker image rm IMAGE` | Remove the image from local
`docker image save IMAGE -o FILE` | Save one or more images to a tar archive
`docker image load -i FILE` | Load an image from a tar archive
`docker container ls` | List running containers
`docker container ls -a` | List all containers
`docker container stats` | Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics
`docker container run IMAGE` | Download the image, if not already downloaded, and start a container from it   
`docker container top CONTAINER` | Display the running processes of a container
`docker container inspect CONTAINER` | Display detailed information for a container
`docker container exec CONTAINER` | Execute a command inside the container
`docker container logs CONTAINER` | Display logs of the container

- `IMAGE` - each image has a specific name to be addressed on a registry. On Docker Hub, the simple form of `IMAGE` is:
  > `REPONAME[:TAG]`

  `TAG` is optional and its default value is `latest`. However, defining a specific tag is highly recommended to assure you about the version of the used image.
  Some examples are `mysql:5.7`, `openjdk:8u191-alpine`, `redis:5.0.4-stretch`, and etc.
  
  The general form of `IMAGE` on a registry server is[^docker_fqn]:
  > `[[HOSTNAME[:PORT]/]USERNAME/]REPONAME[:TAG]`

- `CONTAINER` refers to the name or id of a container

**Note:** as stated in the previous table, the following command shows three popular information of an `IMAGE`.
In [MySQL](#mysql) section, details of the following command is described as an example.
> {% raw %}`docker image inspect -f '{{println "VOL =" .Config.Volumes}}{{println "ENV =" .Config.Env}}{{println "PORTS =" .ContainerConfig.ExposedPorts}}' IMAGE`{% endraw %}


## Real Examples
Lets start real and practical examples.

### MySQL
- **Reference** [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql)
- **Image Information**
  > {% raw %}`docker image inspect -f '{{println "VOL =" .Config.Volumes}}{{println "ENV =" .Config.Env}}{{println "PORTS =" .ContainerConfig.ExposedPorts}}' mysql:5.7`{% endraw %}
  
  --|--
  `VOL = map[/var/lib/mysql:{}]` | it has a volume entry on `/var/lib/mysql` inside the container
  `ENV = [...]` | list of defined environment variables
  `PORTS = map[3306/tcp:{} 33060/tcp:{}]` | exposed ports to be bound on the host
- **Starting container**
  > `docker container run -d -v /opt/docker/mysql:/var/lib/mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root --restart=always --name MySQL mysql:5.7`

  --|--
  `-d` | the container is detached and executed in background
  `-v /opt/docker/mysql:/var/lib/mysql` | _HOST_`:`_CONTAINER_ for mapping volume, so `/var/lib/mysql` directory of container is mapped on `/opt/docker/mysql` directory of host
  `-p 3306:3306` | _HOST_`:`_CONTAINER_ for binding ports
  `-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root` | assign value `root` to environment variable `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, so the password of _root_ user in mysql is set to `root`
  `--restart=always` | on next host reboot or power-on, the container starts automatically (like services in Windows)
  `--name MySQL` | `MySQL` is assigned as the name to this container to be addressed easily (`CONTAINER` in above table, is this name).<br/>**note**: this name also used as network name for the container
  `mysql:5.7` | the `IMAGE` reference
- **Calling _mysql_ client CLI**
  > `docker container exec -it MySQL mysql -uroot -proot`

  --|--
  `-it` (i.e. `-i -t`) | `-i`: Keep STDIN open even if not attached `-t`: Allocate a pseudo-TTY
  `mysql -uroot -proot` | the command and its arguments executed inside the container
  
  <!-- TODO: mysql client tutorial -->
- **Watching logs of mysql server**
  > `docker container logs -f MySQL`

  --|--
  `-f` | it works like `tail -f` in Linux

### Redis
- **Reference** [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)
- **Starting container**
  > `docker container run -d -v /opt/docker/redis:/data -p 6379:6379 --restart=always --name Redis redis:5.0.4 redis-server --requirepass PASSWORD`
  
  --|--
  `redis-server --requirepass PASSWORD` | passing custom command to be executed on container startup instead of its default one
- **Calling _redis-cli_ client**
  > `docker container exec -it Redis redis-cli -a PASSWORD`

  <!-- TODO: redis-cli tutorial -->
  
### Oracle Database
- **Reference** [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/oracle-database-enterprise-edition) (note: click on "Proceed to Checkout")
- Some official images, like Oracle DB, is available through Docker Store, and they need an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- **Starting container**
  > `docker container run -d -it -p 1521:1521 -v /opt/docker/oradb:/ORCL --restart=always --name OracleDB store/oracle/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1`

  - you need to login to pull this image, so execute `docker login` before pulling
  - the container for Oracle DB needs the `-it` switches, even if it is detached (`-d`)
- **Calling _sqlplus_ client**
  - `sys`@CDB
  > `docker container exec -it OracleDB /bin/bash -c "source /home/oracle/.bashrc; sqlplus '/ as sysdba'"`
  - `sys`@PDB
  > `docker container exec -it OracleDB /bin/bash -c "source /home/oracle/.bashrc; sqlplus sys/Oradoc_db1@ORCLPDB1 as sysdba"`

  - Oracle 12c introduces a new architecture called **multitenant**. In this new architecture, a database instance consists of two main sections
    - A **container**, called _CDB_, which is the basis environment of the instance
    - One or more **pluggable DBs**, called _PDB_, which is an end-user database for applications (this image has only one PDB)
  - The PDB information of this image
    - Name is `ORCLPDB1` and its `sys` password is `Oradoc_db1`
    - **JDBC URL** - `jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521/orclpdb1.localdomain`  

  <!-- TODO: sqlplus tutorial -->
  
### Sonatype Nexus
- **Reference** [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3)
- **Starting container**
    > `mkdir -p /opt/docker/nexus/data` <br/>
    > `chown -R 200:200 /opt/docker/nexus` <br/>
    > `docker container run -d -v /opt/docker/nexus/data:/nexus-data -p 8081:8081 -e NEXUS_CONTEXT=nexus --restart=always --name Nexus sonatype/nexus3:3.15.2`

    --|--
    `-e NEXUS_CONTEXT=nexus` | Start the server with `/nexus` context path (useful for Nginx forwarding)

    - Test the server - `curl -u admin:admin123 http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/metrics/ping`
    - Visit [localhost:8081/nexus](http://localhost:8081/nexus), and login with default username `admin` and password `admin123`

### Jenkins Blue Ocean
- **Reference** [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean)
- **Starting container**
  > `docker container run -d -u root -v /opt/docker/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 8080:8080 -e JENKINS_OPTS="--prefix=/jenkins" --restart=always --name Jenkins jenkinsci/blueocean:1.14.0`

    --|--
    `-u root` | Username or UID (format: `<name|uid>[:<group|gid>]`), so user `root` is set as the owner of the process
    `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock` | Allow jenkins to create a container by calling Docker on your host (**Docker-in-Docker**)
    `-e JENKINS_OPTS="--prefix=/jenkins"` | Start the server with `/jenkins` context path (useful for Nginx forwarding)
    
    - Visit [localhost:8080/jenkins](http://localhost:8080/jenkins)

### Nginx + Jenkins + Nexus
Lets mix up things and create a little bit advanced example to highlight Docker networking.
This practical example can be used as a basis for a CI (continuous integration) environment.
Following picture shows the final result of the example (note: the IPs can be different when you execute the example).

<a name="nginx">
![Nginx](/assets/images/docker/Nginx.png)
</a>

The next script implements above picture:
```sh
docker network create DokNet1

mkdir -p /opt/docker/nexus/data
chown -R 200:200 /opt/docker/nexus
docker container run -d \
 -v /opt/docker/nexus/data:/nexus-data \
 --network DokNet1 -e NEXUS_CONTEXT=nexus \
 --restart=always --name Nexus sonatype/nexus3:3.15.2

docker container run -d -u root \
 -v /opt/docker/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home \
 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
 --network DokNet1 -e JENKINS_OPTS="--prefix=/jenkins" \
 --restart=always --name Jenkins jenkinsci/blueocean:1.14.0

mkdir -p /opt/docker/nginx
cat > /opt/docker/nginx/nginx.conf << "EOF"
server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;

server {
  listen 80;
  server_name localhost;
  client_max_body_size 80M;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;

  location /nexus/ {
    proxy_pass http://Nexus:8081/nexus/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  }

  location /jenkins/ {
    proxy_pass http://Jenkins:8080/jenkins/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  }
}
EOF

docker container run -d \
 -v /opt/docker/nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf \
 --network DokNet1 -p 80:80 \
 --restart=always --name Nginx nginx:1.15.10

```

- Line 1 - Docker creates a virtual network, called `DokNet1`.
  - **Check it by executing `docker network inspect DokNet1`**
  ![DockerNetInspect1](/assets/images/docker/DockerNetInspect1.png)
  
  - After this command execution, a long string is printed on screen which is identifier of this network. Its first 12 characters is also unique and we call it `NET_ID`.<br/>
  ![DockerCreateNet](/assets/images/docker/DockerCreateNet.png)
  
  - Executing `ifconfig`, it is in the list by the name of `br-NET_ID`
  ![DockerIfconfig2](/assets/images/docker/DockerIfconfig2.png)
  
- Option `--network DokNet1` attaches the container to `DokNet1` network, so all of the above containers are in the same network ([picture](#nginx)).
- Lines 17-38 create a config file for Nginx
  - Line 27 - Nginx forwards request to Nexus by calling `http://Nexus:8081/nexus/`, which restates the fact that containers can access each other by the name in the network.
  - Line 33 - It is the same as previous line for Jenkins.
- Only Nginx has a binding port. It is not necessary for Jenkins and Nexus to bind ports.
- Accessing web apps
  - Jenkins - [localhost/jenkins](http://localhost/jenkins)
  - Nexus - [localhost/jenkins](http://localhost/nexus). Executing `curl -u admin:admin123 http://localhost/nexus/service/metrics/ping` is another way.
- At the end, execute `docker network inspect DokNet1` again. You can see list of containers attached to this network.
