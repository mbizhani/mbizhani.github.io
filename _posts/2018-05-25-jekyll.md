## Creating a Simple Blog Site
What you need:
- A GitHub account
  - A repository with the name of `<USERNAME>.github.io`
  - A pushed project of `Jekyll`
- A DNS name for your blog (Optional): [More Info](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages)

## Installation (Ubuntu/Debian)
The main installation guide: [Jekyll Site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation)
```sh
root$ apt install ruby ruby-dev build-essential
```

```sh
user$ echo 'export GEM_HOME=$HOME/App/Gems' >> ~/.bashrc
user$ echo 'export PATH=$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
user$ source ~/.bashrc
user$ gem install jekyll bundler  # - Installing jekyll via Ruby Gems
user$ jekyll -v                   # - My Version: 3.8.2
user$ jekyll new myblog           # - Create a project based on Minema template
user$ cd myblog
user$ bundle exec jekyll serve    # - Build & Execute a local web server 
```
The last command starts a local webserver with address [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) to review the blog.
To stop it, just press `ctrl+c`.

The contents in folder `myblog` are:
- _posts/
- _config.yml
- .gitignore
- 404.html
- about.md
- Gemfile
- index.md

### Preferred Setting
File `_config.yml` is the configuration of the site based on YAML format (mostly `key: value` pairs).
Preferred altered config entries are:

```yml
title: <SITE TITLE>
email: <EMAIL>
description: <DESCRIPTION>
author: <DEFAULT_SITE_AUTHOR>

url: "<DNS_URL_NAME or <USERNAME>.github.io>"
google_analytics: true
permalink: /:categories/:title
show_excerpts: true

github_username: <G_USERNAME>
twitter_username: <T_USERNAME>
linkedin_username: <L_USERNAME>

markdown: kramdown
theme: minima
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed

defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: posts
    values:
      author: <DEFAULT_BLOG_ENTRIES_AUTHOR>
```

### Create a Post
- Must create a file in the `_posts` directory with name of pattern: `<YEAR>-<MONTH>-<DAY>-<NAME>.md`
- Must starts the file with following content at top (called [Front Matter](#front-matter)):
```yml
---
layout: post
title: "<TITLE>"
categories: <CAT1> [, <CAT2>, ...]
excerpt: <EXCERPT> 
---
```
- Now continute the content based on [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) format

### Create a Page
- A page is a link that is shown at the top header of your blog (menu bar)
- By default, an `about.md` page is created
- To add a page, just create a `<NAME>.md` file in the root of your project with following content at top
(called [Front Matter](#front-matter)):
```yml
---
layout: page
title: "<TITLE>"
permalink: /<LINK>/
---
```
- Now continue the content based on [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) format

**Note**: In my case, I created a `pages` directory in the root of the project, and I saved all my pages in it, even `about.md`. 
Jekyll automatically finds all the pages in all normal directory (not started with `_`) and generates them in the root of your blog.


## Basics
- After building the site, `_site/` is created.
- All regular files are copied to `_site/`, unless it starts with `_`.
- After `Gemfile` modification, execute `bundle update`
- For GitHub Pages Gem (set in `Gemfile`), execute `apt install zlib1g-dev` by root user
- The default theme is `minema`
- Execute `bundle show minima` in project root directory: it shows the home directory of theme gem `minima` (i.e. `$GEM_HOME/gems/minima-2.4.1`).
In spite of older version, the following directories are in theme home directory:
  - `_includes/`
  - `_layouts/`
  - `_sass/`
  
  **Note**: you can copy any above directory to the site to change the default generation behavior.


### Front Matter
- The content between two `---` at the above of an `.md` file.
- It is in JSON or YAML format, each row is a `key: value` pair. In fact they are **meta-data** for a post!

#### Post
- Except the `layout`, other keys are optional!
```

layout: post
title: "<TITLE>"
date: <YEAR>-<MONTH>-<DAY> <HOUR>:<MINUTE>:<SECOND> <TIME_ZONE>
categories: <CAT1> [, <CAT2>, ...]
excerpt: <EXCERPT>

```

#### Page
- Except the `layout` and `title`, other keys are optional!
```
