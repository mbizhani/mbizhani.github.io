excerpt: A simple introduction to Jekyll setup as static blog generator for GitHub Pages

## Creating a Simple Blog
What you need:
- A GitHub account
- A repository with the name of `<USERNAME>.github.io`
- A pushed project of `Jekyll`
- A DNS name for your blog (Optional)

## Installation (Ubuntu/Debian)
The main installation guide ([Jekyll Site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation))
```sh
root$ apt install ruby ruby-dev build-essential
```
**Note**: For GitHub Pages Gem, execute `apt install zlib1g-dev`


```sh
user$ echo 'export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
user$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
user$ source ~/.bashrc
user$ gem install jekyll bundler  # - Installing jekyll via Ruby Gems
user$ jekyll -v                   # - My Version: 3.8.2
user$ jekyll new test             # - Create a project based on Minema template
user$ cd test
user$ bundle exec jekyll serve    # - Build & Execute a local web server 
```
Contents in folder `tests` are:
- _posts/
- _config.yml
- .gitignore
- 404.html
- about.md
- Gemfile
- index.md


## Basics
- After building the site, `_site/` is created.
- All regular files are copied to `_site/`, unless it starts with `_`.
- The default theme is `minema`
- Execute `bundle show minima`: it shows the home directory of theme gem `minima`.
In spite of older version, the following directories are in theme home directory:
  - `_includes/`
  - `_layouts/`
  - `_sass/`
  
  Note: you can copy any above directory to the site to change the default generation.

## My Setting
File `_config.yml` is the configuration of the site based on YAML format (mostly `key: value` pairs). Preferred altered config entries are:

```yml
title: <SITE TITLE>
email: <EMAIL>
description: <DESCRIPTION>
permalink: /:categories/:title

github_username: <USERNAME>
twitter_username: <USERNAME>
linkedin_username: <USERNAME>

defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      author: "<DEFAULT AUTHOR>"
```

## Front Matter
- The content between two `---` at the above of an `.md` file.
- It is in JSON or YAML format, each row is a `key: value` pair. In fact they are **meta-data** for a post!
