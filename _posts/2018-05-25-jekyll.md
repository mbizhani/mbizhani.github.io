## Installation (Ubuntu/Debian)
The main installation guide [Jekyll Site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation)
```sh
root$ apt install ruby ruby-dev build-essential
```
**Note**: For GitHub Pages Gem, execute `apt install zlib1g-dev`


```sh
user$ echo 'export GEM_HOME=$HOME/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
user$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
user$ source ~/.bashrc
user$ gem install jekyll bundler
user$ jekyll -v  # --- My Version: 3.8.2 ----
user$ jekyll new test
user$ cd test
user$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Contents are:
- _posts/
- _config.yml
- .gitignore
- 404.html
- about.md
- Gemfile
- index.html


## Basics
- The default theme is `minema`
- After building the site, `_site` is created!
- Any file or folder starts with `_` is ignored.
- Execute `bundle show minima`: it shows the home directory of theme gem `minima`.
In spite of older version, the following directories are in theme home directory:
  - `_includes`
  - `_layouts`
  - `_sass`
  
  Note: you can copy any above directory to the site to change the default generation.

## My Setting
File `_config.yml` is the configuration of the site based on YAML format (mostly `key: value` pairs). Preferred altered config entries are:

```yml
title: <SITE TITLE>
email: <EMAIL>
permalink: /:categories/:title
github_username: <USERNAME>
twitter_username: <USERNAME>
linkedin_username: <USERNAME>

defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      author: "<DEFAULT AUTHOR>"
```

## Front Matter
- The content between two `---` at the above of an `.md` file.
- It is in JSON or YAML format, each row is a `key: value` pair
