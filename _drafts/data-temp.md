## Basics
- Population & Sampling: Strategies
  - Stratified: sampling based on the key characteristics to represents the population
  - Random
- Designing Research
  - Experimental: 
  - Non-experimental 
- Variables R = F(X)
  - R, Dependents/Targets/Outcomes (e.g. cholesterol level)
  - X, Independents/Predictors (e.g. features of the drugs)


## Variable & Statistical Tests

|                  | Nominal Indep | Oridinal Indep | Continuous Indep
-------------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------
**Nominal Dep**    | Chi-square Test of Independence | Chi-square Test of Independence | Logistic Regression, Discriminant Analysis   
**Ordinal Dep**    | Nonparametric Tests | Nonparametric Correlation | Ordinal Regression  
**Continuous Dep** | T-Test, ANOVA | Nonparametric Correlation | Correlation, Linear Regression

## Tests

### Chi-square Test of Independence
- Studies the relationship between two or more categorical variables
- Determines if one category of a variable is more likely to be associated with a category of another variable
- Hypothesises
  - **Null**: Variables are not related to each other (variables are independent)
  - **Alternative**: Variables are related to each other (variables are associated)


When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$$

$$mean = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$
