After 13 years of software development, I strongly believe in modular architecture and well-defined components. 
To realize this belief, I have been developing an open source family of projects with [**`“Demeter”`**](https://github.com/mbizhani/Demeter) as its core. 
It is a full-stack integration of well-known frameworks (**Hibernate**, **Spring** and **Wicket**) and a container of **“business-level component”**, called **“DModule”**.

Another area that I am so interested is data analysis and mining, and I have approached it both scientifically and technically. 
In the banking domain, I have developed data warehouse and BI projects, and proposed a target marketing solution via data mining. 
My current project in this area is [**`“Metis”`**](https://github.com/mbizhani/Metis) DModule, which is an open source SQL-based application for reporting and data analysis.
