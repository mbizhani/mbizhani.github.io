Software production is full of challenges: 
> analyzing, designing, developing, testing

and more importantly
> **integrating**, **maintaining**, **extending**, and **scaling**.

After 13 years of software development, I strongly believe in modular architecture, well-defined components and assets to deliver a successful product.
To realize this belief, I have been developing an open source family of projects with [**`“Demeter”`**](https://github.com/mbizhani/Demeter) as its core.

Besides a full-stack integration of well-known frameworks (e.g. `Hibernate`, `Spring`, and `Wicket`), `Demeter` is a **`“DModule”`** container and provider of basic services. 
Each DModule is a **“business-level component”** with its own web panels, services and entities, and is focused on its core issues. 
I also have been developing two DModules: [**`“Metis”`**](https://github.com/mbizhani/Metis) is for SQL search and reporting, and [**`“Ares”`**](https://github.com/mbizhani/Ares) is a web console for operation.

This family is the essence of all my experiences and a proof of concept to develop an integrated platform of modular blocks with high maintainability and fast feature extension.
